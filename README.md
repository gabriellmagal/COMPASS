### About

**COMPASS** is a work-in-progress suite of computational tools designed to process and analyze phonetic alignments of **Portuguese**, specifically those generated by the [**Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)**](https://montreal-forced-aligner.readthedocs.io/). The project aims to bridge the gap between the raw output of a forced aligner and the need for queries based on complex phonological structures, such as the syllable.

The workflow is divided into three main stages, each executed by a dedicated R script:

1.  **Syllabic Structuring:** The first script processes the raw `.TextGrid` files from MFA, enriching the alignment by adding a syllable tier with phonetic syllabification and stress placement information.
2.  **Indexing and In-depth Analysis:** The second script further analyzes the structure by classifying each phone (as Onset, Nucleus, or Coda) and consolidates all files into a single, query-optimized database (`.rds` file), enriching it with lemma and part-of-speech information.
3.  **Interactive Search and Exploration:** The final component is the graphical user interface (a Shiny app), which allows the researcher to visually explore the database, perform complex queries, and extract the corresponding audio segments and `.TextGrid` annotations.
